# Metis-Project-4

### Natural Language Processing
This projected attempted to organize the 1890 edition of Emily Dickinson's poetry using NMF machine learning 'clustering'. The poety was editted and organized by the late poet's brother's mistress Mabel Loomes Todd who worked as a publisher and had extensive correspondence with Emily Dickinson over the course of her life. They had never met and the work was published without the support of Emily's sister Lavinia and her sister-in law Susan Dickinson, both of whom wanted to the poetry to be published with less editting and more emphasis on Emily's personal insights on life. THe complete edition of Emily Dickinson's poetry was not released until 1955 as a direct result of the famliy feud between Todd and the Dickinson's each believeing they had the sole right to the work. NLP is an approach that could test the clustering of the poems examining works and measuring the relationships between works with in a topic. This could help future publications of her work look at different or similiar descriptors as centriods for the peoms clustering.
